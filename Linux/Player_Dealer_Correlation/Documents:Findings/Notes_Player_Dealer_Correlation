- Each of the 13 losses at the roulette table occurred when Billy Jones was dealing. 

- The player Mylie Schmidt was also present at the roulette table for each of the 13 losses.

- Since both the dealer, Billy Jones, and the player Mylie Schmidt were both at the roulette table on each of the dates and time
  when losses occurred, this leads me to believe Billy Jones and Mylie Schmidt worked together to cause losses to the casino.
